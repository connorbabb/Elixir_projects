Tutorial/Notes:
- .exs files are for interpreted code, .ex is for compiled code.
- "mix" is the build tool for elixir, we use to build and run projects.
- There are no multi line comments, easily. Just use multiple #s.
- .puts will print something to the console quickly. Inspect will show what a variable is stored as.
    - puts is shorthand for "put string."
IO.puts("Hello, World!")
- Also: Toggle View/Word Wrap or Alt+z to make long comments wrap.
