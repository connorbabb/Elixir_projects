Purpose of creating a virtual machine in a cloud environment like DigitalOcean:
    - You can create a virtual server in just minutes to experiment, develop, or host. You can resize or clone your virtual server easily, making them extremely scalable as your project grows. You only pay for what you use, again, making them very useful for learning without committing long term to a cloud server system. It is easily accessible remotely through ssh.
    - We would create a virtual machine when we want to have any kind of service that involves a server receiving and processing requests from a user. This virtual machine acts as our server. Without this websites can't be hosted, and database management is much more difficult. A VM also stays on 24/7 even when our laptops are asleep, the server in the cloud can still function and complete requests from users.

Describe an example of how someone might use a newly created virtual machine in a real-world scenario. Be clear and specific, and avoid any code or symbolic notation.
    - I am a local farmer in the Idaho. I own 100 cattle. I am using a software to track data on my cattle such as their weight, how much feed they consume, etc. One day, I want to know how much feed the average cow on my farm is consuming. I have been sending cattle data to a database using the virtual machine for montsh. I log onto the software and request this data from the virtual machine. The virtual machine is hosting the software, and managing the data. The VM will fulfill this request by looking at the data it stores and then share the data back to me. Using a virtual machine is necessary here because it provides a reliable, always-on environment where the data is stored and processed, and it allows me to securely access the system even when I’m not on the farm.

What is the purpose of using SSH in cloud environments like DigitalOcean, and why is it important for VM operations?
    - SSH stands for secure shell. It lets you securely connect to your virtual machine from another computer. Usually through CLI. It is vital for virtual machines since it allows you to control your virtual machine from anywhere, you can log in, run commands, install software, manage files, from anywhere. SSH encrypts all information and data sent between your device and the VM, meaning you are much less likely to get hacked. SSH login uses key pairs which are much harder to be guessed or stolen.

Intermediate example of how HTTP certificates are used in a cloud system:
    - Lets say I run a health and wellness website on a DigitalOcean Droplet that collects personal information through an online form. To keep this data secure, I install an HTTP certificate (SSL/TLS certificate) on his server. This certificate enables encrypted communication between users and the site, so that sensitive information, like names or symptoms, can’t be intercepted or read by outsiders. It also lets browsers confirm that the website is legitimate, displaying a lock icon and using "https" in the address. This builds trust with visitors and ensures their data stays private during transmission.

Purpose of HTTP certificates in cloud systems:
    - To secure communication between users and cloud-hosted services by encrypting data and proving the identity of the server. It proves to the user that the site they are on is secure, trusted, and real.
